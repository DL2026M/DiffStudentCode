| February 3rd |          11:25am - 11:55am          | The problem set was introduced to me during this time. I noticed that there is some similarities between this problem set and DNA, which found the largest pattern of repeating sequences. In addition, I fully understand what the problem set is asking (sometimes it takes me a bit to understand the problem). |
| February 4th |           6:15pm - 6:45pm           | I think that a way to approach this problem would be check the next letters only by the length of the current longest pattern. If the longest current pattern is 4 letters, then you can check 5 letters from the current index and if that is in the pattern, check the previous patterns. If this isn't in the pattern, then move the index over by one. |
| February 4th |           7:35pm - 8:05pm           | During this time I thought more about how to solve this problem efficiently. I first wrote out an example problem on a whiteboard to see if I would notice any patterns. I then tried to see if those patterns applied to another example, but unfortunately nothing stood out on my 2 examples. |
| February 5th | 9:40am - 9:55am + 11:55am - 12:10pm | I wrote a couple of base cases, as I assume this problem will probably get split into smaller parts to solve. In addition, I thought about pairing certain letters up to see if they made logical sense (though not sure if the checks are for real English or just made up stuff) and cutting anything in between that didn't follow. For example, having an x or z after something like a g (not an option in the words in the English dictionary so can just skip right over without checking). |
| February 6th |           2:30pm - 3:00pm           | I finished my code and passed all of the checks! This problem set is quite similar to making change, only with a few different changes. Some of my test cases take 0 milliseconds to run, which is quite cool! |
