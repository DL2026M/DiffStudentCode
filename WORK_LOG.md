| February 3rd | 11:25am - 11:55am | The problem set was introduced to me during this time. I noticed that there is some similarities between this problem set and DNA, which found the largest pattern of repeating sequences. In addition, I fully understand what the problem set is asking (sometimes it takes me a bit to understand the problem). |
| February 4th |  6:15pm - 6:45pm  | I think that a way to approach this problem would be check the next letters only by the length of the current longest pattern. If the longest current pattern is 4 letters, then you can check 5 letters from the current index and if that is in the pattern, check the previous patterns. If this isn't in the pattern, then move the index over by one. |
| February 4th |  7:35pm - 8:05pm  | During this time I thought more about how to solve this problem efficiently. I first wrote out an example problem on a whiteboard to see if I would notice any patterns. I then tried to see if those patterns applied to another example, but unfortunately nothing stood out on my 2 examples. |
